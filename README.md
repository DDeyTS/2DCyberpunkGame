# 2DCyberpunkGame

This personal repository stores all the code of my first C game that I'm working on deeply. It initially started as an **isometric 2D game**, but after some *headache* it ended up being a common **top-down game** (like *Pok√©mon*, for instance).
The used library is totally Allegro 5.
